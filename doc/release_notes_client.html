        an iOS client with the BigWorld server. This makes use of a new code
        generation tool called ProcessDefs, which removes the need for entity
        definition files on the client-side by generating code to stream
        property and method call data from and to the server, and also allows
        for using other client-side scripting environments. This client
        implements entity behaviour in Objective-C++, using the
        Cocos2D third-party library. The example's Xcode project file is

        Action.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Blooming on shader 2 and above cards no longer require a
        full-sized intermediate render target. This greatly reduces its memory
        footprint, with the only visible change being that it will now miss
        blooming 1-pixel sized regions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Bloom settings are now accessible via python, see the client

        allow for a smooth transition when an entity changes to a new
        filter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Removed TERRAIN_SPECULAR_ENABLE shader macro, cutting the number
        of required shader compilation combinations in half. This macro was

        variable.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The ActionMatcher now stops the currently matched action when it
        is decoupled. This was done because any matched action that is looped
        will continously play and blend with other actions. If you want to
        recreate this behaviour you should decouple the ActionMatcher and
        explicity call the action you want.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The ActionMatcher now has an option to use the entity's model
        instead of the owner's model for checking movement / rotations. This
        can be used to apply the action matcher to models attached to an
        entity.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>PyModel now has an option to call move on attached objects. Move
        is used to rev motors. In particular, this allows the action matcher
        to apply to models attached to other models.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Improved the camera flythroughs to avoid bumpiness and to use

        of the method <code class="code">Moo::RenderContext::drawPrimitive</code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The SpeedTree integration has been updated to use version
        4.2.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added maximumSlope to physics, used by AvatarStylePhysics.
        Disallows movement into any area that does not have at least one
        surface less than the allowable slope amount.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added SimpleGUIComponent.horizontalPositionMode and
        SimplyGUIComponent.verticalPositionMode properties to control how the
        position of a component is interpreted (e.g. whether they are defined
        in pixel or clip coordinates). See the Python API documentation for
        SimpleGUIComponent.position for details.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>SimpleGUIComponent.widthRelative and
        SimplyGUIComponent.heightRelative have been deprecated and replaced
        with widthMode and heightMode. See the documentation for
        SimpleGUIComponent.width and SimpleGUIComponent.height to see how
        these new modes affect how the size of the component is interpreted.
        For existing .gui files, you can use the AssetProcessor to
        automatically convert to the new size modes
        (DeprecatedGuiSizeModeFix).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added screenToLocal and localToScreen helper methods to the
        SimpleGUIComponent class to ease coordinate conversions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It is now possible to override the screen resolution that the
        GUI uses to perform calculations using GUI.setResolutionOverride. This
        is useful for scaling UI's defined in PIXEL coordinates.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All GUI components now have the pixelSnap setting (was
        previously only available on text components). This is now implemented
        at the vertex shader level by snapping the vertices to the nearest
        pixel boundary. This is useful when trying to achieve 1-1 pixel
        mapping between GUI artwork and the screen. Pixel snapping is enabled
        by default, so be aware of this setting if you are using GUI
        attachments in the 3D scene.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All GUI components now default to the "POINT" filter type for
        newly created components, rather than defaulting to "LINEAR".</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added TextGUIComponent.stringDimensions, which returns both the
        width and height of the given string in pixels.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added ability to preload sound banks as specified in the
        <code class="code">engine_config.xml</code> file.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Extra functionality has been added to the Python Tracker to
        allow for smooth blending of quick node angle changes. Please see the
        client Python API for more details on angularThreshold and
        angularHalflife in BaseNodeInfo object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Increased the fixed frame time when profiling when using either
        <code class="code">BigWorld.runSoakTest</code> or
        <code class="code">BigWorld.runProfile</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Extra optional parameter have been added to
        <code class="code">BigWorld.runProfile</code> in order to specify the number of
        runs to perform and set the csv output file path name root.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>PyTextureProvider.width and PyTextureProvider.width have been
        added to give read-only access to the width and height of the
        referenced texture.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Removed legacy definition PRESERVE_V18X_DISCONNECTED from
        bigworld/src/client/entity_manager.hpp. This macro allowed entity
        manager to clear all server spaces and entities when disconnected.
        This behaviour should now be done via python scripts using
        BigWorld.resetEntityManager and BigWorld.clearAllSpaces (please refer
        to python documentation for more information)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added load timing functionality to FantasyDemo. Example usage:
        run fantasydemo.exe with "-sa loadtimer -sa spaces/highlands" to write
        results to load_timers.csv. This allows users to time loading a space
        to far plane from command line and could even be part of an automated
        test. <em><span class="remark">Bug 17882</span></em></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added the following debug watchers:</p><p><code class="code"> Client Settings/Entity Filter </code>, which enables or
        disables entity position historical filtering.</p><p><code class="code"> Memory/TextureManagerReckoningFrame </code>, which is the
        amount of texture being used by textures in the last frame.</p><p><code class="code"> Render/FPSAverage </code>, which is the frames-per-second
        running average for the last 50 frames.</p><p><code class="code"> Chunks/Loaded Chunks </code>, which is the number of
        loaded chunks.</p><p><code class="code"> Render/Draw Calls </code>, which is the number of
        DrawCalls of the previous frame.</p><p><code class="code"> Render/Primitives </code>, which is the number of
        Primitives drawn in the previous frame.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added initial health levels for the creatures. This is
        configurable through editing
        "scripts/common/GameData/CreatureData.py". The table is called
        healthTable. The young striff was set to 50 health and both the crab
        and the chicken set to 25.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added functionality to auto-detect graphics settings. The
        graphics settings and detection criteria are defined in xml. See the
        <span class="literal">Client Programming Guide</span> chapter
        <span class="literal">9.2.1</span> for more details.<em><span class="remark">Bug
        19890</span></em></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added a faceCamera option to GuiAttachment. An example usage of
        this is to attach a text label above a player's head, and have the
        text label drawn in 3D space, be occluded by the scene and get larger
        or smaller based on distance to the camera. Please refer to python
        documentation for more information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>SimpleGUIComponent.reSort now also updates the draw order
        of that component and its children without needing to call
        GUI.reSort. C++ subclasses of SimpleGUIComponent that specialise
        calcDrawOrder need to instead specialise calcDrawOrderRecursively.

        RestoreActionState </code> methods to the <code class="code"> ActionQueue </code>
        class. These allow the state of the action queue to be saved before
        reloading a supermodel and then restored. This is useful for
        dynamically swapping models in real time without losing the model's
        current action data.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added the <code class="code"> BigWorld.PyResourceRefs </code> class. This
        class holds onto resources loaded in the background thread via <code class="code">
        Entity.prerequisites </code> or <code class="code"> BigWorld.loadResourceListBG
        </code></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added the <code class="code"> BigWorld.loadResourceListBG </code> function.
        This function loads a list of resources in the background thread, and
        calls a callback function when complete. It passes an instance of
        <code class="code"> BigWorld.PyResourceRefs </code> into the callback function.
        Note that this behaves exactly like a runtime version of <code class="code">
        Entity.prerequisites </code> . Script writers can manage the lifetime
        of the resources via this object. Note that if you upgrade to the new
        <code class="code"> Entity.onEnterWorld </code> method then you have greater
        control over the lifetime of the entity's prerequisites, as the
        resources are passed into that method.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added a few new Python API functions that can be used to fade
        between sky boxes and to control other weather variables. Examples of
        their usage can be seen in client WeatherSystem.py script, or by
        pressing CTRL+0 in FantasyDemo for a client-only randomised weather
        system demo.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added the Distortion channel. This channel is used for objects
        that want direct access to the main render target as a texture. It is
        used by the water for its refractions. See the the
        bigworld/res/shaders/std_effects/distort.fx shader for another example
        of its usage.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The water shader now has a high quality mode that includes
        simple shore animation and foaming as well as some fogging of the
        refraction for deep parts of the water.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There is now a way to access the depth information of the scene.
        An MRT texture is created to hold this information. Refer to <code class="code">
        src/lib/romp/full_screen_back_buffer.cpp </code> .</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Moo RenderContext now supports multiple render targets. All
        previous calls to the d3d device SetRenderTarget should now go through
        the RenderContext::setRenderTarget(..).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There is a new data section type: <code class="code"> ZipSection </code> . It
        implements the creation/loading of zip files that can be used to
        replace the usage of a BinSection with multiple children. These are
        especially handy for development time because they allow easy access
        to internal data structures of previously solid binary blocks. They
        also support partial loading and compression of the internal files.
        The .cdata files used for space data, and shader .fxo's are now in
        this zip format.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>.fx files may now be preloaded by the application. Doing so will
        help smooth the frame-rate, but like all preloads it will incur memory
        usage that exists throughout the lifetime of the application.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>.fx files can now be built offline using the RebuildShaders.py
        script. This will build shaders using all possible setting
        combinations, so that the end-user doesn't have to compile them
        themselves the first time the client is start (and whenever certain
        graphics settings are changed).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The client can now be run without the source shader .fx files if
        the corressponding .fxo files exists.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added a new type of script object, the user data dbject, which
        allows embedding user-defined data in chunk files. A key feature of
        user data objects is their linkability, which allows both entities and
        user data objects to link to other user data objects. They can be
        instatiated in the client or the server.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Added the Vector4Morph Vector4Provider class. Please see the
        client Python API for full details of this class.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="3.&nbsp;Changed Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e4822"></a>3.&nbsp;Changed Features</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Morph animations no longer blend against each other, this means
        that you can play back two morph animations at the same time without
        the result of them being halved. Morph animations can still blend in
        and out using the action system.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The interface of the callback function passed to <code class="code">
        BigWorld.connect </code> has changed.</p><p>The second parameter is now the status enumeration defined in
        <code class="code"> login_inface.hpp </code> , in string form, and the third

        from <code class="code"> PyObjectPlus </code> , instead they each have a
        corresponding python wrapper class. This change was made to allow
        particle systems to be able to be fully loaded in the background
        thread.</p><p>Customers that have modified this system will need to merge
        their changes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Warnings are now enabled as errors on all VC2005 projects (using
        the <code class="code"> /WX </code> compiler flag).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unknown D3D error codes will now be output in the more useful
        hexadecimal format. Also, the <code class="code"> DVDERR_DRIVERINTERNALERROR

        replaced in favor of Python's standard version.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The collision test in <code class="code"> BigWorld.addDecal </code> has been
        changed to detect collisions in the same way a straight call to <code class="code">
        BigWorld.collide </code> would.</p><p>Previously, it would ignore collisions detected at or closer to
        0.1 metres from the origin of the collision ray. This behaviour can be
        reverted by setting <code class="code"> PRESERVE_V18X_COLLISION_OFFSET </code> to 1

        </em> documentation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The client no longer clears all entities and spaces data when

        BigWorld.clearAllSpaces </code> and <code class="code"> BigWorld.resetEntityManager
        </code> when a disconnection occurs. This behaviour can be reverted
        back to the way 1.8.x worked by setting the <code class="code"> #define
        PRESERVE_V18X_DISCONNECTED </code> in <code class="code">
        bigworld/src/client/entity_manager.hpp </code> .</p><p>For details, see the <em class="emphasis"> Client Python API

        root.</p><p>In this case, the GUI script should add it itself (most probably
        from the <code class="code"> onLoad </code> notification method). If the loading
        screen GUI does not have an associated script, then the old behaviour

        bwclient lib.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The FantasyDemo solution now explicitly includes dependencies
        for each module, rather than having FantasyDemo project include all
        other modules.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="code"> math3D </code> library has been been renamed to

        compiling under GCC.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Water no longer creates a second render target for refraction.
        It now uses the new Distortion channel.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Movements in water now have a particle system associated with

        unit for cues was in seconds, when it should have been in frames.
        Developers worked around the problem either by multiplying the cue
        time by the frame rate, or by dividing the frame time by the frame

        which happened because the source <code class="code"> .fx </code> file was kept in
        memory after use. The shader caching was also changed to only compile
        the shader, and not load it into memory -- a shader will now only be

        focus flags.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fixed a crash in Pixie.createBG.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Pixie.createBG now loads the entire system in the background
        thread. This fixes a problem where the use of Pixie.createBG would
        cause a spike in the frame rate.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Chunk Particle systems now load the entire system in the
        background thread. This fixes a problem where the use of Chunk
        Particle systems would cause a spike in the frame rate.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Fixed possible issues when using <code class="code">
        BigWorld.spaceLoadStatus() </code> after teleporting between

        followed by the point lights and spot lights.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The light container selection for visual compounds has been
        improved. It now uses the combined bounding box of all the objects to
        determine the lights.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The effect visual context will now check the maximum number of
        lights available instead of blindly uploading everything. This fixes

        pipeline.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The "mipSkip" flag no longer gets applied to cube maps.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Speedtree LOD values are now calculated from the closest point
        to the eye instead of always being the base of the tree. This fixes
        some lodding issues when trees are scaled.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A missing rain_splashes.xml no longer causes a crash.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="5.&nbsp;Deprecated Features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e5265"></a>5.&nbsp;Deprecated Features</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="code"> BigWorld.windowSize </code> method has been

        have known issues with BigWorld resource manager. As a workaround,
        either the WinZip GUI or the 7-Zip command-line tools can be
        used.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Python code will not operate when inside a zipped resource file,
        whether compressed or not.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>All spotlights are treated as specular regardless of whether
        they have the <code class="code"> specular </code> set.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Occasionally, terrain polygons (on new terrain spaces) are
        clipped incorrectly on GeForce 6600 cards.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="code"> ENABLE_CULLING_HUD </code> option defined in <code class="code">
        mf/src/lib/cstdmf/config.hpp </code> has been disabled. If it is
        re-enabled then crashes can occur.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Running both the client and the tools simultaneously can exhaust
        video memory and cause undefined behaviour in both
        applications.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <code class="code"> /3gb </code> Windows boot option can sometimes cause
        instability with DirectX applications such as the client.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>GUI files are not completely loaded in the background using
        <code class="code"> Entity.prerequisites </code> or <code class="code">
        BigWorld.loadResourceListBG </code> . Only the XML file describing the
        gui tree is loaded. To workaround this, you will need to load the gui
        XML file in the background (or preload it), and parse the gui file
        looking for texture maps, then load the texture maps in the background
        using <code class="code"> BigWorld.loadResourceListBG </code> .</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The direction of the wind setting that applies to the weather
        and to particle systems is not the same direction as the wind that
        gets applied to the flora. Additionally, while speedtrees listen to
        the weather's wind setting, it is not obvious that the wind in the
        trees is coming from that direction at all.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code"> .chunk </code> files packed with <code class="code"> res_packer

        for spot lighting. When you have one or more spot lights inside a
        shell that are using dynamic lighting, at least one will produce an
        incorrect lighting result.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>There is currently no way to destroy an individual decal, only
        the whole set. This makes it difficult to use decals on models that
        change, for example, a wall that collapses.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Particles using local-space rendering do not collide correctly
        using the Collide Action.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Callbacks registered using BigWorld.callback(..) are not
        guaranteed to be called back in the order they were added,for

        elements.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Flora wind is separate from the Speedtree / Particles
        wind.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Action matcher plays its matched actions on Track 0, thus
        overriding the track number you may have selected for the action in
        ModelEditor. Having said this, the interrupt/blend rules for actions
        still work consistently, so any actions played explicitly on track 0
        will interrupt action matched actions. However it is worth noting that
        the action matcher is implicitly overriding the track number
        allocated.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Large client spaces can exhibit floating point precision issues
        depending on the distance from the origin. This can become aparent as
        early as 6-7,000 units distance from the origin if models use a lot of
        overlapping geometry. Animation can become jerky at about 15,000 units
        from the origin.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An assert is triggered when running the client and power saving
        mode kicks in. (i.e. the laptop is running low on batteries)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Models whose set of material groups and tints do not match those
        names used in its LoD parent will sometimes render using an incorrect
