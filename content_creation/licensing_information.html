<!-- BIGWORLD External Libraries Licensing issues -->
<h1>BigWorld Technology External Libraries Licensing Issues</h1>

<hr>

<p> The BigWorld Technology incorporates multiple external libraries, each
	under their own licence. In order to comply with the different licensing
	requirements of these libraries the following files are provided:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>The <a href="development_and_deployment_licensing.txt">development_and_deployment_licensing.txt</a>
		file contain licence agreements of external libraries included in the
		BigWorld server, server tools and client tools components.</p></li>
	<li><p> The <a href="game_client_licensing.txt">game_client_licensing.txt</a>
		file contains the licence agreements of external libraries included in
		the BigWorld game client. This file should also be included in the
		documentation and/or other materials provided with any game which is
		created by BigWorld customers based on the BigWorld client. If Adobe
		Flash is not redistributed, the Adobe Flash section should be removed
		from this file before redistribution.</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Flash LICENSING CONSIDERATIONS -->
<h2>Flash Licensing Considerations</h2>

<p>The BigWorld Technology Evaluation version includes the Adobe Flash Player
	component. This component is used to show Flash content as part of the
	evaluation version. Redistribution of the Flash Player component is done
	based on a licence coordinated with Adobe. Customers wishing to
	redistribute Adobe Flash Player should coordinate a similar licence using
	<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/players/fpsh_distribution1.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/players/fpsh_distribution1.html</a>
	or instead make sure their installer links to a page allowing to install
	Flash Player for Firefox (plugin based).</p>

<p>Following is the Flash Player Copyright:</p>
